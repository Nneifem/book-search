# book-search

## Description

I built this website in order to have a place where you can create an account, search for books, and be able to add or remove books from your library. This can be a convenient way for people who loves to read be able to have somewhere to store their favorite books or keep track of what they read. In making this, I learned how to use MERN all together and specifically being able to practice how mutations, typeDefs, and resolvers works.


## Installation

To get this to run, you will need to do an npm install and npm init -y globally. In the server folder you will repeat that and install the following:
- @apollo/server
- bcrpyt
- express
- graphql
- jsonwebtoken
- mongoose

Lastly, in the client server you will need to do the following to install vite:
- npm create vite@latest
- click yes
- select react as the framework
- select JavaScript for variant
- npm install
- npm run dev

Afterwards the website should be ready to run.

## Usage

After installing everything, when you open the website, on the top right corner you can either sign up or login or just search for a book. Once signed in and search for a book, you can save the book and if you go to the see your books sections, you can view the books you saved and can remove them from the list.
